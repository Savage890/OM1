feat: Persist conversation history to disk with auto-save (Bounty #985)

## Description
This PR implements conversation history persistence, allowing the robot to "remember" past interactions after a restart. It addresses Issue #985.

## Key Changes
- **Persistence Provider**: Implemented `save_history` and `load_history` in `LLMHistoryManager` to serialize conversation history to a JSON file.
- **Robustness**: Uses atomic writes (serialize to temp file -> rename) to prevent data corruption during crashes.
- **Auto-Save**: Automatically saves history to disk every `N` messages (configurable via `save_interval`, default: 10).
- **Thread Safety**: Uses `asyncio.Lock` to ensure thread-safe access to history during file I/O operations.
- **Configuration**: Added `history_file_path` (default: `data/conversation_history.json`) and `save_interval` to `LLMConfig`.

## Testing
- Added unit tests in `tests/test_history_persistence.py` verifying:
    - Saving and loading history.
    - Auto-save filtering.
    - Handling of corrupted history files (backup logic).
- Verified manually by restarting the agent and checking context retention.
